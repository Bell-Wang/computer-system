In this assignment, a simple topic-based document search engine using the Machine Learning Library of Apache Spark was build. The tasks include computing the term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (tf- idf), cluster the pages based on their TFIDF scores using K-Means clustering algorithm and find topic words of each cluster, stream the input file using Spark Streaming, and finally query your database using SparkSQL.
